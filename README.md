## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The imapct and benefit Lend.com has had in the fintech leading space is being able to simiplify, but also open up the market to more lending options by building stronger, effiecent and reliable systems to the industry's traditalonal processes.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

KPIs(Key preformace indicators) in this domain are, but not limited to analzing personal/business health, this could be assessing value of properties, equimpment, vehicles and also considering liquidity, profiabiliy and potential growth of assets. Also comparisons to simialr businesses allow for somewhat a reflection of a buisnesses health relative to another's. 

Smallbuisnessloans Australia, which reviews lending products services has given graded them with there own critera. Lending Varity - 100%,  Level of Service - 100%, Sign Up Process - 100%, Client Reviews - 97%
although this is broad, these metrics are compared to countless amounts of others in the industry and has been given a star rating 4.82/5. 


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Fundera ltd is another company that offers very similar solutions to that of Lend.com, only major difference is that Fundera Ltd operates in the U.S. allowing for a large market, therefore giving it a greater growth potential.

Another company to mention is SoFi ltd, this company differs by having a larger more diverse slection of products and services. From offer tradional business and personal loans it also can of options suchs as Life insurance, mortage loans, refinaincing, student loans and wealth management. This call this selection 'social finance'. They also take in KPIs such as work experince and education background to give them a re larger and more accurate scope of their customers needs and capibilites.

Lend.com may have the largest loan marketplace in austraila and hsare similar technologies to the companies above, but because of it geographical market cap it will not be able to reach the same volume or growth potential as Fundera and SoFi if it does not breach it's current location paramitters. Although Lend could learn a lot and increase it business potential in Australia if it decided to increases in product and service selections like SoFi has done.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Cryptocurrency lending

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think matching cunsomers with for cyrptocurrency lenders would firstly incorperate a product that is already increaseing it'sdemand and use in the worlds market which would allow the buisness to increase it's domains market share, but this product could also allow the company to breach it geographical limits of Australia and therefore increase its buisnesses potential growth. Businesses are increasling finding ways to implement crypto currenies into their buisesses stratigies and some say the cryptocurrenies will be the next biggest finaical product to be on the market.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?


Blockchain - Crypto Currency 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Cryptocurrency is life or death with Blockchain technologies therefore without the use of blockchain there is no cryptocurrency or at least a way to trade/share it unless you like paying cash in hand for a USB drive that contains crypto currency, but it is highly unlikely that this would be the mojaroity preffered method around the world. Blockchain will support the solution by allowing for a global market and to facailite the cryptocurreny transactions.
